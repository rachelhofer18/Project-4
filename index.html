           <h2> The "Why" to Responsive Web Design</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="box2 para_2">
           <p-2> Have you ever been on a website on your laptop or destop computer and then tried to
                get onto the same website on your phone and it looks completely different or doesn't function
                properly? Well that's why Responsive Webdesign is so important. By designing a website page or
                 website to function on every screen, more users will be able to access your content and
                content can be used and seen in a much easier way. Using RWD allows
                developers to create sites that function for every user on any screen without any hastle.
