## Project 4
### THIS PROJECT ABOUT KILLED ME!
#### I don't know what it was about this project but I just could not figure it out
#### and I never really did.
#### I had the hardest time trying to get my boxes into columns and so I finally
#### gave up, as you can see, after hours and hours of struggling.
##### I think I at least someone managed to figure out the general concept of the
##### project b the end however.
##### I have to say that this project definetely stressed me out the most out
##### of all of them. However I made it through, not too successfully, but I made it
##### This class has taught me so much not only in the world of coding, but about me
##### and my patience level. While there were times I just wanted to give up and
##### drop the class, I kept going and have made it.
###### I ended up using this color pallette [pallette] http://htmlcolorcodes.com/assets/images/resource-color-palette-generators/html-color-codes-color-palette-generators-colour-code-d98dba3d.jpg
###### I really ended up liking the general look of my page, but wished I could Have
###### figured out what I was doing wrong, or just wasn't doing at all.
### Thank you all for a wonderful semester! I am both excited and sad to be done.
### It's a bittersweet moment for sure! Good luck with everything everyone!
